## Favon Roadmap

Favon is currently in a pre-alpha stage, meaning most features are still missing. Below is a rough sketch of features that will be coming to Favon in the upcoming months. No concrete dates are mentioned since it's hard to predict how long each feature will take and I'm working on this in my free time, though I am including a rough timeframe that I will try to follow. No guarantees though.



#### 2018

| Feature           | Explanation                                                  | Timeframe     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Seasonal Overview | Overview page that lists all tv shows by season, with extensive filters. Users should be able to manage their list status for all shows from this page. | June 2018     |
| Authentication    | Allow sign up, login and logout.                             | June 2018     |
| Refactoring       | The Backend, and _especially_ the frontend need some refactoring to improve code quality and structure. | June 2018     |
| TV Show Details   | Detail page for a TV show, listing all information (title, description, images, actors, ratings, scores, genres, seasons, etc.) | August 2018   |
| TV Season Details | Same as above, but for each individual tv season.            | October 2018  |
| Person Details    | Detail page for an individual person (e.g. actor), with stuff they have are credited for | November 2018 |
